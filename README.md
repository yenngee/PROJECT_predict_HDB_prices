# PROJECT_predict_HDB_prices

## Questions:
How much does a flat actually cost within the area? Is the government overpricing the flat? What factors contribute to the prices of HDBs and resale? Would the price of the flat I own rise in the future?

These are the questions that have been running through my head even before embarking on this project and these questions are common for any Singaporean looking to get a house. Through analyzing the resale and BTO (built-to-order) data found from data.gov.sg. I hope I am able to answer these questions or at least have a better understanding of them to choose my own house in the near future. :) 

## Notes:
